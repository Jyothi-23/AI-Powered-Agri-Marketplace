                    <li>Watering Techniques: Avoid overhead watering. Use drip irrigation to prevent wet leaves, as rust needs moisture to infect plants. If using sprinklers, water early in the morning.</li>
                    <li>Dispose of Infected Plants Properly: Never compost diseased plants. Seal them in plastic bags and discard in the trash.</li>
                    <li>Fall Cleanup: Remove dead leaves and cut back rust-affected plants to break the rust cycle. Dispose of leaves properly, not in compost.</li>
